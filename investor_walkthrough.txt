NextGen Organics - Complete Ecosystem Walkthrough
Brief & Technical Overview
Executive Summary
NextGen Organics is a comprehensive farm-to-table platform combining a frictionless consumer mobile app with a powerful backend administration system. Our dual-model approach ("Hub Store" for speed, "Farms" for transparency) addresses the two biggest market needs: convenience and trust.

Section 1: Mobile App (User Journey)
_Focus: Simplicity, Transparency, and Conversion_
1. Smart Home Dashboard
The Command Center
The entry point focuses on ease of access. Users can search, browse categories, or use our proprietary Hub/Farms Toggle.

Next: User selects "Farms" to find local growers.

2. Farms Directory (Direct Sourcing)
Transparency First
This view replaces products with Vendors. It is a directory of verified local farms, building trust by showing _who_ is selling.
User Sees: List of verified farms with ratings and location.
Action: Clicks on a specific farm card.
Next: Opens the dedicated vendor storefront.

3. Vendor Storefront
The "Zomato" for Farms
Each vendor gets a dedicated profile page. This digital storefront allows farmers to brand themselves and list their specific inventory.
User Sees: Farm details, hero image, exclusive product list.
Action: Selects a product to view details.
Next: Navigates to product details.

4. Product Details & Discovery
Informed Purchasing
High-fidelity product pages drive conversion. The Suggestion Engine keeps users engaged by showing "More from this Farm".

5. Smart Cart & Checkout
Frictionless Conversion

Next: Order tracking.

6. Profile & Loyalty
Retention Loop
The profile acts as the post-purchase hub for tracking orders and reordering favorites.

Section 2: Admin & Vendor Web Panel (Control Flow)

3. Vendor Verification & Management
The Trust Layer
This is where the "Verified Farm" badge comes from. Admins review documents before activating a vendor.

Section 3: System Flow Explanation
How a Farm becomes a Seller:
1.  Application: Vendor visits website -> "Join as Vendor" -> Uploads FSSAI/Organic Certificates.
2.  Verification: Admin receives alert -> Manually verifies ID & Certs -> Contacts Vendor.
3.  Onboarding: Admin approves account -> Generates Credentials -> Vendor gains Dashboard access.
4.  Go-Live: Vendor lists products -> Admin approves listings -> Products appear instantly in Mobile App "Farms" tab.
